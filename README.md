# Yr0WardrobeApp
Wardrobe app I built as part of my foundation year of my Computer Science degree

'''
STYLE ME APPLICATION

Style me is a fashion app where users can store their wardrobe and
their personal “lookbook” on their phone for easy access to all their
clothes and to help save time when planning what to wear for the day. 

This is my first version of the application and I hope to continue
working on it at some point. The original idea I had for the
application was a lot more complex than the one I made and have
submitted for this coursework.

Features of this version include:

    - Wardrobe (unordered and uncatagorised)
    - Outfits page
    - Basic item page
      ~Title
      ~Image
      ~Location
    - Basic add page
      ~...(same as item page)
    - .png only

Things I have not yet accomplished but have tried:
    
    - AddToCollection function
    
    - adding items to list or database
    
    - Displaying images other than .png
    
    - All sqlite stuff
    
    - displaying images on buttons in wardrobe + outifts
    
->(check open_wardrobe for attempt)
